  This component is responsible for configuring GuardDuty within an AWS Organization.

  AWS GuardDuty is a managed threat detection service. It is designed to help protect AWS accounts and workloads by
  continuously monitoring for malicious activities and unauthorized behaviors. To detect potential security threats,
  GuardDuty analyzes various data sources within your AWS environment, such as AWS CloudTrail logs, VPC Flow Logs, and DNS
  logs.

  Key features and components of AWS GuardDuty include:

  - Threat detection: GuardDuty employs machine learning algorithms, anomaly detection, and integrated threat intelligence
    to identify suspicious activities, unauthorized access attempts, and potential security threats. It analyzes event
    logs and network traffic data to detect patterns, anomalies, and known attack techniques.

  - Threat intelligence: GuardDuty leverages threat intelligence feeds from AWS, trusted partners, and the global
    community to enhance its detection capabilities. It uses this intelligence to identify known malicious IP addresses,
    domains, and other indicators of compromise.

  - Real-time alerts: When GuardDuty identifies a potential security issue, it generates real-time alerts that can be
    delivered through AWS CloudWatch Events. These alerts can be integrated with other AWS services like Amazon SNS or AWS
    Lambda for immediate action or custom response workflows.

  - Multi-account support: GuardDuty can be enabled across multiple AWS accounts, allowing centralized management and
    monitoring of security across an entire organization's AWS infrastructure. This helps to maintain consistent security
    policies and practices.

  - Automated remediation: GuardDuty integrates with other AWS services, such as AWS Macie, AWS Security Hub, and AWS
    Systems Manager, to facilitate automated threat response and remediation actions. This helps to minimize the impact of
    security incidents and reduces the need for manual intervention.

  - Security findings and reports: GuardDuty provides detailed security findings and reports that include information
    about detected threats, affected AWS resources, and recommended remediation actions. These findings can be accessed
    through the AWS Management Console or retrieved via APIs for further analysis and reporting.

  GuardDuty offers a scalable and flexible approach to threat detection within AWS environments, providing organizations
  with an additional layer of security to proactively identify and respond to potential security risks.

  ## Supported GuardDuty Protection Features

  This component supports the following GuardDuty protection features:

  - **S3 Protection**: Monitors S3 data events to detect suspicious activities in your S3 buckets
  - **EKS Audit Log Monitoring**: Analyzes Kubernetes audit logs from Amazon EKS clusters
  - **Malware Protection**: Scans EBS volumes attached to EC2 instances for malware
  - **Lambda Protection**: Monitors Lambda function network activity logs
  - **Runtime Monitoring**: Provides runtime threat detection for EC2, ECS, and EKS workloads with automatic security agent management

  ## SNS Notifications

  This component creates its own SNS topic, SQS queue, and KMS key for GuardDuty findings notifications instead of using
  the ones from the upstream `cloudposse/guardduty/aws` module. This is a workaround for
  [cloudposse/terraform-aws-guardduty#10](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-guardduty/issues/10) where the
  module's SNS topic encryption doesn't grant EventBridge permission to decrypt messages.

  The component creates:
  - A custom **KMS key** with proper permissions for EventBridge, SNS, and SQS services
  - An **SNS topic** encrypted with the custom KMS key
  - An **SQS queue** subscribed to the SNS topic for message processing
  - **CloudWatch Event Rules** to route GuardDuty findings to the SNS topic

  To enable notifications, set `create_sns_topic: true` and `cloudwatch_enabled: true`.

  ## Prerequisites

  Before deploying this component, ensure that GuardDuty trusted access is enabled in AWS Organizations. This can be done
  by adding `guardduty.amazonaws.com` to the `aws_service_access_principals` list in your `account` component, or by
  running the following command from the management account:

  ```bash
  aws organizations enable-aws-service-access --service-principal guardduty.amazonaws.com
  ```

  ## Deployment Overview

  This component is complex in that it must be deployed multiple times with different variables set to configure the AWS
  Organization successfully.

  It is further complicated by the fact that you must deploy each of the the component instances described below to every
  region that existed before March 2019 and to any regions that have been opted-in as described in the
  [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-regions).

  In the examples below, we assume that the AWS Organization Management account is `root` and the AWS Organization
  Delegated Administrator account is `security`, both in the `core` tenant.

  ### Step 1: Deploy to Delegated Administrator Account

  First, the component is deployed to the
  [Delegated Administrator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_organizations.html) account in each
  region in order to configure the central GuardDuty detector that each account will send its findings to.

  ```yaml
  # core-ue1-security
  components:
    terraform:
      guardduty/delegated-administrator/ue1:
        metadata:
          component: guardduty
        vars:
          enabled: true
          delegated_administrator_account_name: core-security
          environment: ue1
          region: us-east-1
  ```

  ```bash
  atmos terraform apply guardduty/delegated-administrator/ue1 -s core-ue1-security
  atmos terraform apply guardduty/delegated-administrator/ue2 -s core-ue2-security
  atmos terraform apply guardduty/delegated-administrator/uw1 -s core-uw1-security
  # ... other regions
  ```

  ### Step 2: Deploy to Organization Management (root) Account

  Next, the component is deployed to the AWS Organization Management, a/k/a `root`, Account in order to set the AWS
  Organization Designated Administrator account.

  Note that you must use the `SuperAdmin` permissions as we are deploying to the AWS Organization Management account. Since
  we are using the `SuperAdmin` user, it will already have access to the state bucket, so we set the `role_arn` of the
  backend config to null and set `var.privileged` to `true`.

  ```yaml
  # core-ue1-root
  components:
    terraform:
      guardduty/root/ue1:
        metadata:
          component: guardduty
      backend:
        s3:
          role_arn: null
        vars:
          enabled: true
          delegated_administrator_account_name: core-security
          environment: ue1
          region: us-east-1
          privileged: true
  ```

  ```bash
  atmos terraform apply guardduty/root/ue1 -s core-ue1-root
  atmos terraform apply guardduty/root/ue2 -s core-ue2-root
  atmos terraform apply guardduty/root/uw1 -s core-uw1-root
  # ... other regions
  ```

  ### Step 3: Deploy Organization Settings in Delegated Administrator Account

  Finally, the component is deployed to the Delegated Administrator Account again in order to create the organization-wide
  configuration for the AWS Organization, but with `var.admin_delegated` set to `true` to indicate that the delegation has
  already been performed from the Organization Management account.

  ```yaml
  # core-ue1-security
  components:
    terraform:
      guardduty/org-settings/ue1:
        metadata:
          component: guardduty
        vars:
          enabled: true
          delegated_administrator_account_name: core-security
          environment: use1
          region: us-east-1
          admin_delegated: true
  ```

  ```bash
  atmos terraform apply guardduty/org-settings/ue1 -s core-ue1-security
  atmos terraform apply guardduty/org-settings/ue2 -s core-ue2-security
  atmos terraform apply guardduty/org-settings/uw1 -s core-uw1-security
  # ... other regions
  ```

  ### Enabling GuardDuty Protection Features

  You can enable various GuardDuty protection features by setting the corresponding variables. Here's an example with
  all protection features enabled:

  ```yaml
  # core-ue1-security
  components:
    terraform:
      guardduty/org-settings/ue1:
        metadata:
          component: guardduty
        vars:
          enabled: true
          delegated_administrator_account_name: core-security
          environment: use1
          region: us-east-1
          admin_delegated: true
          # Protection features
          s3_protection_enabled: true
          kubernetes_audit_logs_enabled: true
          malware_protection_scan_ec2_ebs_volumes_enabled: true
          lambda_network_logs_enabled: true
          # Runtime Monitoring with automatic agent management
          runtime_monitoring_enabled: true
          runtime_monitoring_additional_config:
            eks_addon_management_enabled: true
            ecs_fargate_agent_management_enabled: true
            ec2_agent_management_enabled: true
  ```

  > **Note**: You cannot enable both `eks_runtime_monitoring_enabled` and `runtime_monitoring_enabled` at the same time.
  > Use `runtime_monitoring_enabled` if you want runtime monitoring across EC2, ECS, and EKS resources.

  ### Enabling SNS Notifications

  To enable SNS notifications for GuardDuty findings, set `create_sns_topic` and `cloudwatch_enabled` to `true`:

  ```yaml
  # core-ue1-security
  components:
    terraform:
      guardduty/delegated-administrator/ue1:
        metadata:
          component: guardduty
        vars:
          enabled: true
          delegated_administrator_account_name: core-security
          environment: ue1
          region: us-east-1
          # Enable SNS notifications
          create_sns_topic: true
          cloudwatch_enabled: true
  ```

  This will create:
  - A KMS key with permissions for EventBridge, SNS, and SQS
  - An encrypted SNS topic for GuardDuty findings
  - An SQS queue subscribed to the SNS topic
  - CloudWatch Event Rules to route findings to SNS
